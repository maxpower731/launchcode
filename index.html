         <h2 id="topH2">Who is Max Starkman?</h2>
         <p>A proud husband and father of two beautiful kids transitioning from a successful career in the automotive finance industry to one in aviation. I am a perpetual seeker of challenges: I earned my MBA in 2015 from the University of
            Florida (Go Gators!), earned advanced pilot certificates, and am currently working on completing the LaunchCode
            course to learn JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java. Generally, I don’t like to sit still! Currently focused
            on my passion – AVIATION.</p>

         <p>Here's a video of an approach into Colorado Springs, CO.  You can see Pikes Peak in the background.  Views like this are what makes aviation so cool!</p>

      <h2>My History in Aviation</h2>
   <p>Interest in aviation struck me at a very young age. When I was only 2 years old my parents asked the pilot if I
   could sit in the cockpit. According to them, I refused to leave. Fast forward to high school in the early 2000’s
   and my friends and I discovered you could play multiplayer on our PCs. We hooked up a few computers with LAN
   cables to play Flight Simulator. Those simulated flights often took hours to complete!
   <p>
   Then during my freshman year of high school I went to Fantasy of Flight near Lakeland, FL. It would be my first
   time <em>slipping the surly bonds of Earth</em>. The flight took place in an ultralight with a triangle kite-looking wing.
   What a rush, I was hooked!
   </p>
   <p>Unfortunately, flight training is expensive and I would need to defer my dreams of flying until I had saved up
   some cash. It wasn’t until 2012, during my senior year of college, that I would have sufficient funds. I began
   with a few discovery flights at local airports before ultimately deciding to train at a small airport called Tampa
   North (X39). From start to finish it took me roughly 3 months to earn my <abbr title="Private Pilot License">PPL</abbr>. To this day
   it is one of my proudest accomplishments. </p>

   <h3>Ten-Hi Flyers</h3>
   <p>In 2015 I joined a wonderful group of pilots as part owner of <a href="http://www.tenhiflyers.com">Ten-Hi Flyers</a> in Broomfield, CO. Having access to
      my <q>own</q> plane was a game changer. No longer was I restricted with short rental periods or high (relatively
      speaking) rental costs. Overnight trips to far away destinations were now a possibility. </p>

      <a name = "MtRushmore"></a>
      <section>
      <h3>Mt. Rushmore</h3>
         <p>Driving from Colorado to South Dakota was projected to take around 7 hours. The flight was just under 2 hours with
         favorable winds. While in South Dakota, we stopped into Hot Springs and visited the Mammouth dig site.</p>

         <h3>Jackson Hole</h3>
         <p>This trip was made in November which meant carefully watching the forecast in the weeks leading up to flight.
         Luckily, the weather was fantastic without a cloud in the sky and we caught sight of the winding Snake River.
         Unfortunately, the winds were not so kind and a fuel stop was needed on the way there. On the way back the winds
         were strong enough to make the flight without any stops. </p>

      <a name="SantaFe"></a>
      <section>
         <h3>Santa Fe</h3>
         <p>One of my absolutely favorite cities! The culture and cuisine of Santa Fe make it a great destination. Before
         joining Ten-Hi Flyers I made the drive many times with an average travel time of around 6 hours. The plane made
         the trip in under 2 hours and the views are some of the most impressive anywhere. On a very special trip we
         visited the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta.</p>

         <h3>Las Vegas</h3>
         <p>The Commercial Pilot Certificate requires a long cross-country flight of greater than 300 nautical miles.  What better way to satisfy an FAA requirement than by going to Vegas?!  The flight was over Moab and near the Grand Canyon.  The Western U.S. is stunning.  While in Vegas I even got a chance to see Ed Sheeran in concert.  It was a pretty great trip.</p>

         <h3>Alliance (Solar Eclipse)</h3>
         <p>August 21, 2017 was a very special day across much of North America.  A total solar eclipse would be visible from Oregon to the Carolinas.  When some research revealed that a small airport in Alliance, NE would be entirely within the zone of totality (sun is fully blocked by the moon), I planned to make the trip that instant.  The experience was surreal.  People from all backgrounds came together to witness the once in a lifetime event.  All kinds of airplanes from small propeller planes to business jets converged on the small Nebraska town for the event. </p>
