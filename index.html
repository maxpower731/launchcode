            <h2 id="topH2">A Little About Myself</h2>
            <p>A proud husband and father of two beautiful kids who is transitioning from a successful career in the
               automotive finance industry. I am a perpetual seeker of challenges: I earned my MBA in 2015 from the
               University of
               Florida (Go Gators!), earned advanced pilot certificates (Instrument Rating and Commercial Pilots
               License) in pursuit of my aviation interests, and am currently working on completing the LaunchCode
               course to learn JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java because I love technology. Generally, I don’t like to sit
               still!</p>

            <p>Here's a video of an approach into Colorado Springs, CO. You can see Pikes Peak in the background. Views
               like this are what makes aviation so cool!</p>

            <h2>My History in Aviation</h2>
            <p>Interest in aviation struck me at a very young age. When I was only 2 years old my parents asked the
               pilot if I
               could sit in the cockpit. According to them, I refused to leave. Fast forward to high school in the early
               2000’s
               and my friends and I discovered you could play multiplayer on our PCs. We hooked up a few computers with
               LAN
               cables to play Flight Simulator. Those simulated flights often took hours to complete!
            <p>
               Then during my freshman year of high school I went to Fantasy of Flight near Lakeland, FL. It would be my
               first
               time <em>slipping the surly bonds of Earth</em>. The flight took place in an ultralight with a triangle
               kite-looking wing.
               What a rush, I was hooked!
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, flight training is expensive and I would need to defer my dreams of flying until I had
               saved up
               some cash. It wasn’t until 2012, during my senior year of college, that I would have sufficient funds. I
               began
               with a few discovery flights at local airports before ultimately deciding to train at a small airport
               called Tampa
               North (X39). From start to finish it took me roughly 3 months to earn my <abbr
                  title="Private Pilot License">PPL</abbr>. To this day
               it is one of my proudest accomplishments. </p>

            <h3>Ten-Hi Flyers</h3>
            <p>In 2015 I joined a wonderful group of pilots as part owner of <a href="http://www.tenhiflyers.com">Ten-Hi
                  Flyers</a> in Broomfield, CO. Having access to
               my <q>own</q> plane was a game changer. No longer was I restricted with short rental periods or high
               (relatively
               speaking) rental costs. Overnight trips to far away destinations were now a possibility. </p>

               <h3>Mt. Rushmore</h3>
               <p>Driving from Colorado to South Dakota was projected to take around 7 hours. The flight was just under
                  2 hours with
                  favorable winds. While in South Dakota, we stopped into Hot Springs and visited the Mammouth dig site.

               <h3>Jackson Hole</h3>
               <p>This trip was made in November which meant carefully watching the forecast in the weeks leading up to
                  flight.
                  Luckily, the weather was fantastic without a cloud in the sky and we caught sight of the winding Snake
                  River.
                  Unfortunately, the winds were not so kind and a fuel stop was needed on the way there. On the way back
                  the winds
                  were strong enough to make the flight without any stops. </p>

               <h3>Santa Fe</h3>
               <p>One of my absolutely favorite cities! The culture and cuisine of Santa Fe make it a great destination.
                  Before
                  joining Ten-Hi Flyers I made the drive many times with an average travel time of around 6 hours. The
                  plane made
                  the trip in under 2 hours and the views are some of the most impressive anywhere. On a very special
                  trip we
                  visited the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta.</p>

               <h3>Las Vegas</h3>
               <p>The Commercial Pilot Certificate requires a long cross-country flight of greater than 300 nautical
                  miles. What better way to satisfy an FAA requirement than by going to Vegas?! The flight was over Moab
                  and near the Grand Canyon. The Western U.S. is stunning. While in Vegas I even got a chance to see Ed
                  Sheeran in concert. It was a pretty great trip.</p>

               <h3>Alliance (Solar Eclipse)</h3>
               <p>August 21, 2017 was a very special day across much of North America. A total solar eclipse would be
                  visible from Oregon to the Carolinas. When some research revealed that a small airport in Alliance, NE
                  would be entirely within the zone of totality (sun is fully blocked by the moon), I planned to make
                  the trip that instant. The experience was surreal. People from all backgrounds came together to
                  witness the once in a lifetime event. All kinds of airplanes from small propeller planes to business
                  jets converged on the small Nebraska town for the event. </p>

                  Until recently, I was using Dropbox for my document storage but was running out of space in my free
                  account. To make matters worse,
                  I attempted to install Dropbox on an extra laptop I had lying around and found out that I'd reached
                  the maximum number of devices you
                  can have in a free account.

                  Enter the Raspberry Pi! I discovered the open source cloud server <a
                     href=|https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> could be installed
                  on a Raspberry Pi. I was able to connect an extra 1TB hard drive to the Raspberry Pi and sync up my
                  files without worrying about client
                  or storage restrictions.

                  Pi-hole is another Raspberry Pi project I am glad I found. It provides whole network ad-blocking which
                  has been a total game changer
                  for the house. It blocks ads in websites and in apps. The setup was actually very straight forward and
                  the whole system was up and running in about 30 minutes. The amount of
                  ads Pi-hole blocks is staggering. Since install, it has blocked nearly 50% of the traffic on my
                  network - all ads!

               <p class="lastelement">
                  I came across a tutorial to make a METAR map on Reddit and thought it would be a fun project to try. A
                  METAR is essentially a weather report that contains
                  information relevant to pilots (think wind, visibility, temperature, pressure, etc.). Using a
                  Raspberry Pi Zero and a Python script (see link above) that pulls information from
                  <a href="https://www.aviationweather.gov/">Aviation Weather</a> servers, I was able to make a custom
                  map of the area to show different weather conditions.
